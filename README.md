## Introduction
**MPAD** is a Matrix Profiling-based anomaly detection framework. 

Users of this repo can conduct training and configuring Matrix Profiles through the MPAD framework for detecting anomalies on new time series.

### Framework  

The framework contains two main components: Matrix Profiling and Anomaly Detection.

### Matrix Profile

The MPAD centers around the Matrix Profile. Figure below shows an example of matrix profile generated by two time series, including a benchmark time series (𝑇𝑆𝐵), which does not have any anomalies, and an evaluation time series (𝑇𝑆𝐸) that is used to be compared against.

Using a sliding window of size (𝑤) for subsequence extraction on both benchmark and evaluation time series, a similarity joint for 𝑇𝑆𝐸 with respect to 𝑇𝑆𝐵 is generated as the 𝑀𝑃𝐸𝐵 matrix profile. On the 𝑀𝑃𝐸𝐵 profile, higher values are associated with subsequences in the 𝑇𝑆𝐸 that do not match with the observations in the 𝑇𝑆𝐵 . This profile is used to identify the location of potential anomalies by running a peak selection algorithm.

## Getting Started

### Required Environment/Packages

The following main packages were used：   
[matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/installing/index.html)  / [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html) / [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install) / [keras](https://pypi.org/project/keras/) / [numpy](https://numpy.org/install/) / [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/getting_started/install.html) / [spicy](https://docs.zeek.org/projects/spicy/en/latest/installation.html#) / [tqdm](https://pypi.org/project/tqdm/) / [session-info](https://pypi.org/project/session-info/) 

All the packages can also be referred in [requirements](requirements.txt).

This file may be used to create an environment using:
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

  
### Demo Project

[mpad_demo.ipynb](mpad_demo.ipynb) is an example of how to apply the DEGAN framework with your own time series datasets.

To test and use the framework, you may get a local copy and run the example steps in the demo file.
